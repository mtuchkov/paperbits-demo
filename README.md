### Text edit 
```html
<paper-textblock></paper-textblock>
```
Textblock component support standard set of text styling features.

### Picture edit 
```html

```
You can add a picture element on a page by drag it from file explorer and drop it on a page. 
After the drop, you will see a notification popup to upload the picture to the media library. (Also, you can upload pictures directly to the media library)
As soon as picture file will be uploaded, it will be accessible through the media library for drag and drop on a page.

Another approach adding a picture on a page is drag and drop picture widget from the widget library and upload a picture file through the picture editor.
